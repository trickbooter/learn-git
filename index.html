					<h2>Why Git?</h2>
					<p>
						TL;DR; Everyone else is using it. Skill up.
					</p>
					<ul>
					  <li>Fast</li>
					  <li>Distributed - everyone has a complete local copy</li>
					  <li>Develop offline; see all history</li>
					  <li>Branch, commit, merge locally, paint your picture</li>
					  <li>Encourage better development practices</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Git Repository Concepts</h2>
						<p>(and knowledge check)</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>Repository</li>
						  <li>Repository Areas</li>
						  <li>Branches</li>
						  <li>Remotes</li>
						  <li>The Repository is a DAG</li>
						  <li>Refs</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Repository</h2>
						<ul>
						  <li>A persistant store for your source code</li>
						  <li>Records change history over time</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Repository Areas</h2>
						<ul>
						  <li>Working Copy - the directory that you work in, the repo root</li>
						  <li>Staging/Stage/Index - a commit shopping basket used to organise what goes into a commit</li>
						  <li>Repo - the immutable commit store. The latest commit is referenced as HEAD</li>
						</ul>
						<img data-src="https://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/img/trees.png"/>
						<i>image from Roger Dudler</i>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Branches</h2>
						<ul>
						  <li>ISOLATE your changes from everyone else</li>
						  <li>Make all the mistakes you like on a private branch (but try not to)</li>
						  <li>Switch to other branches to make changes (i.e. make hotfix for release)</li>
						</ul>
						<img data-src="https://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/img/branches.png"/>
						<i>image from Roger Dudler</i>
					</section>
					<section>
					  <h2>The Repo Object Model - DAG</h2>
					  <p>The Repository is a Directed Acyclic Graph</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>Each commit is uniquely identified (circles)</li>
						  <li>Each commit points to only one parent commit (black arrows)</li>
						  <li>Pointers are acyclic (linear, can't create a closed loop of commits)</li>
						</ul>
					  </p>
						<img data-src="http://think-like-a-git.net/assets/images2/reachability-example.png"/>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Refs</h2>
						  <ul>
						    <li>A reference (or ref) is a pointer to a commit or another ref</li>
						    <li>They come in the following flavours: local branch, remote branch and tag</li>
						    <li>A branch is identified by a ref pointing to the last (HEAD) commit on that branch</li>
						  </ul>
						</p>
						<img width="500" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/refs.png"/>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
						<ul>
						  <li>Using Windows?</li>
						  <li>Reveal hidden files in Windows</li>
						  <li>We will be using both Git Bash (cmd line) and Source Tree for the exercises</li>
						  <li>Define a root directory for the exercises. I'll use c:\git</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Create a New Repository

						Objective: Initialise a new repository and look at the git artefacts

						Create a directory for your repository

						* c:\git\learn-git
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## SourceTree

						  * Clone/New
						  * Create New Repository tab
						  * Repo Type=git; Path=c:\git\learn-git


						  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/git-init.PNG)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Git Bash

						Switch to the repository directory

						```
						cd /c/git/learn-git
						```
						Git is implemented in the filesystem. View the repo's git directory using
						```
						ls .git
						```

						Since we have already created a repository, we won't do it again. For completeness, the command is
						```
						git init
						```

						_Keep this window open, you'll need it_
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Add Content

						Objective: Add content to the repo, understand the working copy, staging area and HEAD.

						Create a text file README.md in c:\git\learn-git

						```
						## Learn-Git Readme

						I am learning git
						```

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Add Content Using SourceTree

						  * File will appear as a new file in 'Working Copy'
						  * Set view to 'Pending Files Sorted By Status'
						  * Tick README.md to add file to Staging area
						  * Click commit, add a message "Adding README.md	" and commit


						  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/first-commit-staged.PNG)

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Add Content Using Git Bash

						```
						echo "Another Readme" >> README2.md
						git status
						git add README2.md
						git status
						git commit -m "Adding README2.md"
						```

						_git status_ is very useful
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Modify Content

						Objective: Modify existing content

						Edit the README.md in c:\git\learn-git

						```
						## Learn-Git Readme

						I am learning git.
						Git is great.
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Modify Content Using SourceTree

						  * Files will appear in 'Working Copy'
						  * Tick README.md
						  * Click commit, add a message "Modifying README.md" and commit

						  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/add-mod-unstaged.PNG)

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Modify Content Using Git Bash

						```
						echo "modifying readme2" >> README2.md
						```
						```
						git status
						git add README2.md
						git status
						git commit -m "Modifying README2.md"
						```

						you can also use _git add --all_ to add everything that isn't tracked.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Review History

						Objective: Inspect logs and map understanding to DAG model

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Review History Using SourceTree

						  * Click branches > master

						  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/git-log-ui.PNG)

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Review History Using Git Bash

						```
						git log --oneline --all --abbrev-commit --graph
						```
						_--oneline_ shows line-per-commit
						_--all_ shows refs
						_--abbrev-commit_ first few characters of the commit id
						_--graph_ adds a 'graphical' view of the commit tree
						there are loads of options [here](git-scm.com/docs/git-log) but the UI is easier
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Branching

						Objective: Learn how to create a branch

						Branching isolates your development effort from other branches.

						1. Keep tasks isolated
						2. Improves testability and quality
						3. Developers can keep their efforts separate

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Branching Using SourceTree

						* Right click the commit you wish to branch from (choose the latest commit)
						* Click branch


						 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/branch-ui-menu.png)
						 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/branch-ui-dialog.PNG)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Branching Using Git Bash

						```
						git branch feature-branch-b
						git checkout feature-branch-b
						```

						or shorthand...

						```
						git checkout -b feature-branch-b
						```

						Branches the current branch's latest commit to my-feature-branch-b.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Branching Review

						Look at the refs...

						![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/branches-ui.PNG)

						Both master and feature-branch-a point to the same commit.

						A branch is just a reference to a commit, remember our DAG. The branch doesn't
						physically create a new version of files like it would on TFS or SVN, it just adds a new ref.
						Since we haven't made any changes, both master and feature-branch-a point to the same commit.
						This is why git branching is so fast.

						![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/refs-small.png)
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Switch Between Branches

						Objective: Learn how to switch between branches

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Switch Between Branches Using SourceTree

						* Right click the branch that you wish to checkout
						* Click checkout
						* The branch in *bold* is the checked out branch

						![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/branches-ui.PNG)

						this will swap the files around in your working folder

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Switch Between Branches Using Git Bash

						```
						git checkout feature-branch-a
						```

						Remember you can combine a branch and switch in one command using
						```
						git checkout -b _your-branch-name_
						```
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Merging (Fast-Forward)

						Objective: Learn how to merge.

						We will make a change on feature-branch-a then merge feature-branch-a back into master.

						### What's a Merge and what are we doing?

						Merging allows you to update a branch with the contents of another. Such as merging your-amazing-feature into the master branch.

						We will focus on an easy merge scenarios at this stage. This is a special case called a *fast-forward* merge.

						### fast forward merges
						Remember that a branch is just a *ref* to a commit. If the following is true

						* commits to feature-branch-a
						* no commits to master after creating feature-branch-a

						when we merge feature-branch-a into master they will be identical, so a fast-forward merge _moves the master pointer to the feature-branch-a HEAD_
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Make a change on feature-branch-a

						Merges target the current branch. If we are on master and we merge feature-branch-a, we are asking for feature-branch-a to be merged into master .

						* Checkout feature-branch-a
						* Make a change to c:\git\learn-git\README.txt & commit

						![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/feat-branch-a-change-small.PNG)

						note that master still points to the previous commit, and feature-branch-a has our latest commit
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Merge using Source Tree

						* Checkout master (our target branch)
						* Right click the latest feature-branch-a commit and choose merge

						![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/merge-ui.png)

						As no other changes had occured on master, a merge will result in feature-branch-a and master becoming identical.

						Git recognises this and simply moves the master ref to the same commit as feature-branch-a.

					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Merge using Git Bash

						```
						git checkout feature-branch-a
						echo "another change" >> README.md
						git add --all
						git commit -m "changed README.md"
						```

						* Switch to master and merge

						```
						git checkout master
						git merge feature-branch-a
						```

					</section>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>

						<small>Git Remotes, Branching & Merging</small>
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Remotes

						Objective: Learn what a remote is.

						A remote is another repository that you can link to your repository. **That's all**.

						> You can mark one remote as _default_
						> Convention suggests we name this _origin_

						Typically our default remote is BitBucket or GitHub.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Local / Remote Relationship

						![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/remote-branches-concept.png)
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Remote Branches

						git holds a snapshot of the remote branches (remote refs).

						git only updates these during a git fetch or pull.

						You can see them in SourceTree under Remotes.
						or
						```
						git branch -a
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Cloning Remotes

						To take a copy of a remote repository from BitBucket or GitHub, you **clone** the repository.

						Cloned repositories automatically configure a remote called _origin_ that points to the clone source.

						> Cloning takes a full copy (a clone!) of the remote repository.
						> Cloning using https will always ask for a password.
						> Cloning using ssh requires a one-time certificate setup.

						![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/https-clone.PNG)

						![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/ssh-clone.PNG)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Adding Remotes

						Remotes can be added to an existing repository at any time.

						```
						git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
						```

						Or via the UI.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Clone a remote repository

						Objective: Learn how to clone a remote repository

						Let's clone a remote repository.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Clone using Source Tree

						* Click Clone
						* Fill in the remote repo URL
						  * There are two url schemes, ssh and https. We will use https for simplicity.

						![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/clone-remote.PNG)

						> clone url https://&lt username &gt@bitbucket.org/Retail_Development/learn-git-collab.git

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Review the remote tracking branches

						* Expand the 'origin' remote to view the ** remote tracking branches **
						* They are a snapshot of the remote repository at the time of cloning
						* They are stored locally, but are read-only
						* Git uses then to determine how far ahead or behind your repository is from the remote
						* They provide an offline view of remote repositories

						![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/remote-branches.png)

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Clone using Git Bash

						* Using https
						```
						git clone https://&lt username &gt@bitbucket.org/Retail_Development/learn-git-collab.git
						```

						* Using ssh - (requires setup - another lesson)
						```
						git clone git@bitbucket.org:Retail_Development/learn-git-collab.git
						```

					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Recap on Git Repo

						Objective: Remind ourselves of commits, refs and the DAG

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## DAG

						> The git repository is a Directed Acyclic Graph.

						Commits point one way, towards parents.

						Circular references cannot be created.

						![](http://think-like-a-git.net/assets/images2/reachability-example.png)

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Commits & Commit Hash Codes

						A commit hash provides uniquely identifies a commit:

						> commit hash = func(content + author + date + log + previous commit)

						The DAG and commit uniqueness allows git to quickly assess if a repo is _ahead_ or _behind_ another repo.

					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Refs</h2>

						Refs are pointers to commits. Refs are local branch, remote branch and tag.<p/>

						We saw local branch refs in session one. We will see remote branch refs in this session.</p>

						<img width="500" data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trickbooter/learn-git/gh-pages/assets/refs.png"/>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Fetch, Pull & Push

						Objective: Learn how to interact with remotes

						* Fetch: Updates your repository's remote branches from remote repository
						* Pull: Performs a fetch & merge into the current (tracked) branch. *DON'T DO THIS*
						* Push: Send commits from your repo to a remote

					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Fetch

						> Fetch updates the remote branches of your repository with commits from remote repo(s).

						As commits are pushed to the remote repository, your repository will age.

						Fetch _updates_ your clone with the latest commits from remote repo's.

						Fetch **does not** merge changes into your branch.
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Pull

						A pull is actually two operations

						1. Fetch
						1. Merge

						The merge is performed automaticaly on your current branch.

						A fetch and merge as two operations provides better control.

					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Push

						> Push sends local repository commits to a remote repository

					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Practical Exercise

						*Steps Overview*

						1. Clone a demo repository
						2. Create a new branch
						3. Implement a new 'feature'
						4. Commit your code
						5. Pull any upstream changes
						6. Merge your changes into the master branch
						7. Push to the remote

					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Practical Exercise

						1. Clone

						> git clone https://&lt username &gt@bitbucket.org/Retail_Development/learn-git-collab.git

						2. Create a new branch from master. Call it (yourname)_feature for this demo.

						```
						// ensure that we are on master
						git checkout master
						// branch
						git checkout -b "(yourusername)-awesome-feature"
						```

						3. Open the solution and ADD a class, table or text file. Do not modify existing files. Save the solution (Ctrl+Shift+S)

					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Practical Exercise

						4. Commit your code (VS, SourceTree or git bash)

						```
						git commit -a -m "implemented my feature"
						```

						5. Pull any upstream changes to merge other peoples changes into your code.

						```
						git pull
						```

						6. Merge your changes into master

						```
						git checkout master
						git merge (yourbranchname)
						git add --all
						git commit -m "Merging my aswesome feature into master"
						```
